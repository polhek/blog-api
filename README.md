# Blog page API

This is my first take on making an API. You are able to retrieve all blog posts and its comments. If you have admin username and password you can also delete comments from users, delete or publish/unpublish blogpost. At each login admin JWT token for admin is issued.

## Stack:

- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- PassportJS

## API Deployment:

- API is deployed on Heroku: [Heroku Link](https://fierce-everglades-07063.herokuapp.com/)

## Frontend:

I have also made a frontend for this API, which you can find in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/polhek/blog-front-end-react). And also get more info about the app.
